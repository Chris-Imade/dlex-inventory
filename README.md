## Introduction

Welcome to the Dlex project, an open-source initiative aimed at creating a versatile application for managing the affairs of small to medium-sized organizations. Dlex is designed to reduce fraud within an organization and create a secure and efficient system for managing various aspects, from products to transactions and more.

## Technologies Used

Dlex is built using a stack of modern technologies:

- **Electron:** For the multi-platform desktop application frontend.
- **Node.js:** For the backend server.
- **Express:** As the web application framework.
- **MongoDB:** As the database system.

## Key Features

### Offline and Auto-Syncing

One of Dlex's standout features is its ability to work seamlessly both online and offline. When connected to the internet, data is automatically synchronized with the central server. Users can continue working even when offline, and once they're back online, Dlex automatically syncs their changes, ensuring data integrity and accessibility at all times.

### Automated Reports in Excel Format

Dlex simplifies reporting by generating automated reports in Excel (.xls) format. These reports are sent directly to the user's email, making it easy to access and share critical information. Whether it's transaction summaries, product catalogs, or financial statements, Dlex streamlines the reporting process, saving time and effort for users.
